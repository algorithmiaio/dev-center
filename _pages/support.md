Algorithmia provides distinct levels of support depending on your subscription. Send us an email support request to [support@algorithmia.com](mailto:support@algorithmia.com). Please use your corporate domain email addresses if emailing us directly.

## Algorithmia Teams Pro tier

A value-add feature of the Teams Pro subscription is access to our Technical Support team for any platform and administrative issues as well as user-, data science-, and model-related questions.

### Algorithmia offers several options to contact support
* [Algorithmia Support Portal](https://support.algorithmia.com/) includes FAQs and commonly requested information. It is also the portal for you to reach out for platform and administrative support or user-, data science-, and model-related questions.
* Send us an email support request to [support@algorithmia.com](mailto:support@algorithmia.com). Please use your corporate domain email addresses if emailing us directly.
* If using the Algorithmia Teams (with a Pro subscription) or Enterprise user interface (UI), a Help widget is available on the lower right portion of the screen.

All support inbound and outbound communication is conducted via email.

Platform-wide SL1, SL2, or SL3 incidents will be reported and updated on the [Algorithmia status page](https://status.algorithmia.com/). Please check the status page before reaching out to Support.

### We provide support across three categories of incidents and issues
* 24x7 platform monitoring
* Customer reported platform or administration issues
* User-, data science-, or model-related questions

### Response Time is our stated Service Level Objective (SLO) and it varies by the type of issue as described below

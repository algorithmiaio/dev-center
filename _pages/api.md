Welcome to the Algorithmia API documentation! You can use the API to access any algorithm in the marketplace.

We have clients & libraries in multiple languages. We encourage you to click on the different language tabs at the top of the right-side pane to see code samples in your language of choice.

This documentation will serve as a reference as you start to integrate the Algorithmia API into your code.

If this is your first time trying Algorithmia, you might find it useful to start with our [Getting Started guide]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started), which can be found alongside many other resources in the [Algorithmia Developer Center]({{site.baseurl}}).

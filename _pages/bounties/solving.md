The Algorithmia bounty system is a great way for algorithm developers to challenge themselves, demonstrate their expertise, and earn money. By solving bounties, algorithm developers contribute to the success of other developers and their projects.

A bounty represents demand for a certain algorithm by the community. Once a bounty is solved, the algorithm becomes available in the Algorithmia Marketplace, and made available for all developers to use. For an algorithm developer, this means that you earn money not just for solving the bounty, but on all future use of that algorithm as well.

This guide is for algorithm developers, and covers how to find a bounty, approaches to solving it, creating the algorithm, and the bounty fulfillment process.

### 1. Finding a Bounty
The first step in completing a bounty, is to find a bounty to complete. Our list of current bounties can be found on the [Algorithmia Bounties](https://algorithmia.com/bounties) page.

Every bounty includes some important information you'll want to pay attention to, such as:

* Who created the bounty
* If the bounty is ```Active``` or ```Fulfilled```.
* Days until the bounty expires (All bounties are active for 60 days)
* The bounty amount in USD (this is what you'll earn for solving the bounty)


### 2. Understanding the Problem
It's very imporant to understand the problem before attempting to fulfill a bounty. Be sure to read the bounty description carefully, and request clarification on anything using the discussion board available at the bottom of the bounty's page. The bounty creator will be notified by email.

A few things you'll want to have a good grasp on before proceeding:

* What problem does is this bounty trying to solve?
* Do you need sample data to solve this bounty?
* Did the bounty creator clearly specific the input and output they want?


### 3. Creating a New Algorithm
We've created this guided to [walk you through making and publishing your first algorithm](/basics/your_first_algo/) on Algorithmia. This guide covers how to produce the classic “Hello World” algorithm in Python.

### 4. A Checklist for Success
A quick checklist to make sure everything is in order before submitting your algorithm for review:

- Does the algorithm solve the problem stated in the bounty?
- Is there a clear description of how the algorithm works?
- Did you provide an explanation of how to use the algorithm?
- Is the sample input and output set for the algorithm?
- Has the algorithm been tested against sample data?
- Have all interface requirements required by the bounty been met?
- Is the algorithm publicly published?

If all answers are ```YES```, then you are ready to fulfill the bounty.

### 5. Fulfilling the Bounty
Once your checklist has been completed, head to the bounty page, and click ``` FULFILL BOUNTY```.

Select the appropriate algorithm that fulfills the bounty, and then accept  the terms and conditions of the Algorithmia bounty program by hitting ```SUBMIT```.

### 6. Review process
Once a bounty is submitted, both the bounty creator and Algorithmia will review it. The bounty creator has 30-days to accept or reject the algorithm submitted. Algorithmia may also request changes to the algorithm to ensure security and compliance.

When a bounty is accepted, the algorithm is made available on the platform, and the algorithm developer paid for completing the bounty. The algorithm developer can choose to be paid in USD via Paypal, or in Algorithmia platform credits. Credits can be cashed out at anytime.

If the bounty is rejected, the bounty creator is required to provide a detailed reason why the algorithm does not fulfill the bounty. Algorithmia will help determine if the reasons the algorithm was rejected are valid, or not.

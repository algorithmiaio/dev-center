<h2>Algorithmia Enterprise</h2>
<p class="syn-body-1">Algorithmia, Inc. will support customers who run Algorithmia Enterprise products on supported Operating Systems, irrespective of whether they are running in VMware environments or not.</p>

<p class="syn-body-1">Algorithmia, Inc. supports Operating Systems, not specific hardware configurations. Accordingly, VMware operates as a hardware abstraction layer.</p>

<p class="syn-body-1">VMware supports a set of certified Operating Systems and Hardware, and the customer and VMware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the Hardware or Operating System layer as a result of their use of VMware.</p>

<p class="syn-body-1">Algorithmia, Inc. will not require clients to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-VMware environment; however, Algorithmia, Inc. does reserve the right to request our customers to diagnose certain issues in a native certified Operating System environment, operating without the virtual environment. Algorithmia, Inc. will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.</p>

<p class="syn-body-1">Any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in the sole opinion of Algorithmia, Inc. be related to VMware, will be handled in the following fashion:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Algorithmia, Inc will provide standard support to all Algorithmia Enterprise products.</li>
	<li>If a problem is encountered while Algorithmia Enterprise is/are running in a VMware environment, the client may be required to recreate the problem on a non-VMware server unit, at which time Algorithmia, Inc will provide regular support.</li>
	<li>The client can authorize Algorithmia, Inc to investigate the VMware related items at normal time and materials rates. If such investigation shows that the problem is VMware related, the client may contract Algorithmia, Inc to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible.</li>
	<li>Regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non VMware related issue - time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance, and support will be provided as usual.</li>
</ol>

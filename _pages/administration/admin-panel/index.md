# Overview

If your Algorithmia account has cluster admin privileges, you'll have access to the admin panel, which provides immediate access to a variety of tools to administer and manage resources on your cluster.

The admin panel is broken down into sections to view and manage system health, perform system actions, and manage access privileges. Each lesson in this course covers the functionality provided on one page within one of these individual panel sections. Proceed through these lessons sequentially to learn about all the features and functionality available to you as a cluster admin, or navigate directly to pages of interest using the corresponding links below.

The Administrators page lists users who currently have cluster admin privileges and provides functionality to grant and revoke those privileges. To grant admin privileges to a user, enter their username into the "Add Administrator" box and click the "Add Admin" button. Note that if you're promoting a current user to cluster admin status, you should enter their username, and not their email address (otherwise, they'll get an email to sign up for the platform).

To revoke admin privileges, click the red "X" next to a user's name in the "Administrators" list.

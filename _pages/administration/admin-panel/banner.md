The Banner page provides functionality for displaying a site banner to users on your cluster. Standard banner colors associated with several alert types are provided for convenience, but custom hexadecimal color values of the form `#RRGGBB` can be provided as well. Colors are informational only and have no effect on the functionality of the banner.

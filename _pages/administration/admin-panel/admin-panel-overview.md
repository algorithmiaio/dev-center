title: Admin Panel Overview
---

If your Algorithmia account has cluster admin privileges, you'll have access to the admin panel, which provides immediate access to a variety of tools to administer and manage resources on your cluster.

The admin panel is broken down into sections to view and manage system health, perform system actions, and manage access privileges. Each lesson in this course covers the functionality provided on one page within one of these individual panel sections. Proceed through these lessons sequentially to learn about all the features and functionality available to you as a cluster admin, or navigate directly to pages of interest using the corresponding links below.

*   **System Health**
    *   View algorithm [Environments](/developers/administration/admin-panel/algorithm-environments) installed on your cluster.
    *   View current algorithm [Execution Metrics](/developers/administration/admin-panel/algorithm-executions) on your cluster.
    *   Configure algorithm [Insights](/developers/administration/admin-panel/insights) to monitor and manage algorithms in production.
    *   View and report on platform usage with [Governance Reporting](/developers/administration/admin-panel/governance-reporting).
    *   Monitor the health and performance of your cluster using built-in [Dashboards](/developers/administration/admin-panel/dashboard).
    *   View API [Errors](/developers/administration/admin-panel/algorithm-errors) and associated error message logs on your cluster.
    *   View [GPU usage](/developers/administration/admin-panel/gpu-usage) on your cluster, broken down by worker node.
    *   View Grafana [Logs](/developers/administration/admin-panel/logs), algorithm [Queue](/developers/administration/admin-panel/queue), and [Metrics](/developers/administration/admin-panel/metrics) for your cluster.
    *   Manage Kubernetes [Nodes](/developers/administration/admin-panel/nodes) and view the status of [Workers](/developers/administration/admin-panel/workers).
    *   View [System Component Version](/developers/administration/admin-panel/system-version) information.
*   **System Actions**
    *   Perform [Advanced Actions](/developers/administration/admin-panel/advanced-actions) such as deleting public algorithms.
    *   Display a [Banner](/developers/administration/admin-panel/banner) to notify platform users.

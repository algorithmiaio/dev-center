The System Version page displays the system version number as well as the version hash for each of the system's component services. On this page, you can also generate <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">a usage report showing the monthly average number of concurrent [nodes](./773449) <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">used, based on the daily max number of concurrent nodes provisioned. This report can be generated as a PDF by clicking the "Create Usage Report" button.</span></span>

The System Version page displays the system version number as well as the version hash for each of the system's component services. On this page, you can also generate a usage report showing the monthly average number of concurrent [nodes](/developers/administration/admin-panel/nodes) used, based on the daily max number of concurrent nodes provisioned. This report can be generated as a PDF by clicking the "Create Usage Report" button.

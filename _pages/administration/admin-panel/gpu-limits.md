# GPU Limits

The GPU Limits page provides functionality for setting limits on the total amount of GPU memory that specific algorithms may consume. GPU algorithms can be very memory hungry, so these limits can be set to better manage GPU algorithms' memory usage and ensure that memory isn't being over-allocated.

To update the table and revert it to the default sort order, click the refresh icon at the top-right corner of the table. To delete a GPU limit, click the three vertical dots to the right of the algorithm of interest and click "Delete GPU Limit".

To add a GPU limit, click the "Add Limit" box at the top-right corner of the table. Enter the name of the algorithm for which you would like to set the limit, the version of the algorithm, and the requested limit in MB, and click the "Add Limit" button in the modal to submit the change.

Tableau allows the rapid development and deployment of visualizations, so you can take insights generated by advanced analytics and bring them into the hands of decision makers at the speed of thought.

By integrating Algorithmia into Tableau, you can take these visualizations to another level, enhancing them with machine learning models developed in-house or provided by independent developers on the Algorithmia.com marketplace.

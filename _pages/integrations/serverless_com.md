With the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com), you can quickly build serverless apps across multiple infrastructure providers -- defining your cloud functions and associated services in a single place, then deploying them out to cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google.

### Algorithmia + Serverless.com

To add Algorithmia into apps built on the Serverless Framework, the Algorithm call merely needs to be enclosed in a function wrapper. Now all your favorite GPU-accelerated Machine Learning tools can be part of your Serverless deployment!

The [Wolfram Language](http://www.wolfram.com/language/principles/) is quite powerful and puts a wide variety of algorithms and curated data at your fingertips.

When you're ready to extend this with any of the 8,000+ algorithms available from Algorithmia, or by hosting your own ML Model written in your [preferred language]({{site.baseurl}}/algorithm-development/languages), you can easily do so by calling your Algorithm directly from within Wolfram!

You can run this code sample by downloading the free [Wolfram Engine](http://www.wolfram.com/engine/) and/or [WolframScript](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript), or by using any product you already have which supports the Wolfram Language (such as [Wolfram One](http://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-one/)).

First, we specify the URL of the algorithm we want to run. You can get this from the Algorithm's page (such as [https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis)) under the "Install and Use"> cURL sample -- but in most cases it is just "https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/" followed by the algorithm and version you want to use.

**Enterprise users:** your URL will be custom for your domain, e.g. "https://mydomainendpoint.com/v1/algo/" followed by the algorithm.

Next, we specify the input we want to send to the Algorithm.

Lastly, we set the Authorization and Content-Type headers (your API Key is in [your Account Page](/user#credentials)).

The rest is boilerplate -- no need to change it. We just send the JSON-encoded HTTPRequest via URLRead:

{% highlight bash%}
algo = "https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/nlp/SentimentAnalysis/1.0.5"
input = {"document"->"I love Algorithmia"}
headers = {"Authorization"->"Simple YOUR_API_KEY","Content-Type"->"application/json"}
req = HTTPRequest[algo, <|Method->"POST","Headers"->headers,"Body"->ExportString[input,"json"]|>]
response = URLRead[req, {"Body"}]
{% endhighlight %}

The response variable now contains the Algorithm response, for you to use as you wish:

{% highlight json%}
{
   "result":[
      {
         "document":"I love Algorithmia",
         "sentiment":0.6369
      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "content_type":"json",
      "duration":0.000866891
   }
}
{% endhighlight%}

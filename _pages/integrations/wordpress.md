*WordPress* is one of the most popular tools for creating websites -- about [30%](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/) of all sites are made with WP! It has a thriving marketplace where developers can post their own Plugins, allowing for turnkey integration of custom extensions into any website.

Unfortunately, there are very few PHP-based Machine Learning frameworks, so it has been difficult to add AI into WP sites... until now!

The Algorithmia Plugin for Wordpress shows off a few of our capabilities, adding nudity-checking, image-recognition, and automatic post summarization to your website.  More importantly, it serves as a template for WordPress Plugin developers to integrate any Algorithmia microservice into their own plugins: simply copy the plugin code and hack away!

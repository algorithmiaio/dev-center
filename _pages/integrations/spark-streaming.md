With *Spark Streaming* and Algorithmia you'll be able to integrate deep learning algorithms on live streaming data.

Spark Streaming is the defacto standard for processing live data streams. Combined with Algorithmia, you can integrate unique deep learning models such as <a href="/algorithms/algorithmiahq/DeepFashion">Deep Fashion</a>, <a href="/algorithms/sfw/NudityDetectioni2v">Nudity Detection</a>, <a href="/algorithms/media/VideoTransform">Video Processing</a>, and more by calling Algorithmia API's on your DStream data from Spark. Below is a tutorial and code for getting started with Algorithmia and Spark Streaming, but if you want a higher level view of how Algorithmia and Spark go hand in hand, check out these <a href="https://algorithmia.com/blog/algorithmia-and-spark">slides</a> from our talk on how they fit together.

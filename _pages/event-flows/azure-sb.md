This feature is only available in Algorithmia Enterprise installations.
{: .notice-enterprise}

This guide will walk you through setting up Algorithmia Event Flows using an [Azure Service Bus (SB)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) message broker. Once configured, you can create event-driven workflows in which your algorithms subscribe to an SB queue and are automatically invoked with the contents of messages published to the queue.

## Event Flow configuration overview

The process of configuring Event Flows with an SB message broker involves multiple steps, some of which are to be completed on the Azure side and some of which are to be completed on the Algorithmia side. At a high level, the configuration steps are:

1. [Gather required information from Algorithmia](#1-gathering-required-information-from-algorithmia).
2. [On Azure, create a group of resources](#2-configuring-resources-in-the-azure-portal) (including an SB queue) using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or manually as the situation dictates.
3. [On Algorithmia, create an algorithm and connect it to the SB queue](#3-creating-an-event-flow-in-algorithmia) to subscribe to messages published there.
4. [Test the connection by sending messages](#4-sending-messages-to-the-broker) to the SB queue to be consumed by the subscriber algorithm.

## 1. Gathering required information from Algorithmia

Contact [support@algorithmia.com](mailto:support@algorithmia.com) to obtain the email address of the Azure account running your Algorithmia cluster.

## 2. Configuring resources in the Azure portal

**NOTE:** The steps in this section are to be completed within the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Portal</a>.
{: .notice-info}

### Configure permissions
**NOTE**: You only need to complete these permission configuration steps if you're creating a queue in a **different** Azure account than the one running your Algorithmia instance.
{: .notice-info}

#### Create a custom role in your account

To begin, save the following JSON custom role definition as a local file `GuestRole.json`.

```json
{
  "Name": "QueueReceiver",
  "Id": "88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can receive messages and get connection string",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/queues/authorizationRules/listkeys/action",
    "Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/queues/read",
    "Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/read"
  ],
  "NotActions": [],
  "DataActions": [
    "Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/messages/receive/action"
  ],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888"
  ]
}
```

With this file in place, authenticate with the Azure CLI and then create a custom QueueReceiver role in your account with the command below.

```
$ az role definition create --role-definition GuestRole.json
```

For more information on how to work with the Azure CLI to complete this step, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit the Azure Docs</a>. Note that this step can also be completed via PowerShell or REST API.

#### Invite the Algorithmia account as a guest account in your accountâ€™s Active Directory

Create a new guest user account with the Algorithmia account's email address using the following steps:
* Sign in to the Azure portal as an Azure AD administrator.
* In the left-hand navigation menu, select **Azure Active Directory** (or search for the service in the search bar).
* In the left-hand navigation submenu under **Manage**, select **Users**.
* Select **+ New guest user** from the options along the top.<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_33.png">
* On the **New user** page, select **Invite user** and then add the guest user's information as follows:
  * **Identity** &rarr; **Name**: first and last name of the guest user
  * **Identity** &rarr; **Email address**: email address obtained in [step 1](#1-gathering-required-information-from-algorithmia)
  * **Groups and roles** &rarr; **Groups**: add the guest user to one or more existing groups, or do it later
  * **Groups and roles** &rarr; **Roles**: select the QueueReceiver role you created [above](#creating-a-custom-role-in-your-account)<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_34.png">
  * Click **Invite** to automatically send the invitation to the guest user. A "Successfully invited user" notification will appear in the upper-right corner. The user account is now added to the directory as a guest account with the custom role.

### Create a Service Bus namespace and queue using an ARM template

To begin using Azure SB, you must create a namespace with a name that's globally unique across Azure, and a queue to serve as a message broker. We provide the ARM template below to create these resources. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Azure Resource Manager?</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What are ARM templates?</a> for general information about Azure resource management.

To use this ARM template, search for the **Templates** service in the portal and click **+ Create**.

In the **General** page, provide a **Name** and **Description** for and click **OK**.

Now paste the JSON template below into the text field on the **ARM template** page and click **OK** and then **Add**.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {

  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "2017-04-01",

      "type": "Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {

          "dependsOn": [
            "[concat('Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/', parameters('serviceBusNamespaceName'))]"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "lockDuration": "PT5M",

              "type": "authorizationRules",
              "dependsOn": [
                "[parameters('serviceBusQueueName')]"
              ],
              "properties": {
                "Rights": ["Listen","Send","Manage"]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "QueueConnectionString": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "[listkeys(variables('QueueAPName'), '2017-04-01').primaryConnectionString]"
    }
  }
}
```

The newly created template will now appear in the list on the **Templates** page. If it doesn't appear immediately, try clicking the gray refresh wheel (<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_11.png">). Once the template appears, click **Deploy** from the action menu at right.

In the **Custom deployment** page, select the name of the **Resource group** containing the target Algorithmia cluster's resources.

Fill in the **Service Bus Namespace Name** field in adherence with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicebus/create-namespace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">namespace naming rules</a>; this namespace name must be unique across Azure.

Fill in the **Service Bus Queue Name** field; this will be the name you use to identify your queue from the Algorithmia side.

Fill in the **Location** field with an appropriate Azure region in which to create this deployment.

Review your selections and click **Purchase** to deploy the resources. You can view the deployment status in the notifications area (the bell icon) at the upper-right corner.

**NOTE**: If the deployment fails, it's possible that there's already an existing namespace in the same region with the same name that you chose. If the deployment error message indicates that this is the issue, you'll need to try redeploying with a different name until the deployment is successful.
{: .notice-info}

When the deployment is complete, click on the name of the resource group into which the namespace was deployed. You can filter by **service bus namespace** to see the newly created resource.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/azure-portal-resource-namespace.png">

If you click into the namespace, you'll see the queue listed at the bottom.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/azure-portal-resource-queue.png">

In the left-hand navigation submenu under **Settings**, click **Shared access policies** and click on the **RootManageSharedAccessKey** policy, which should have the **Manage, Send, Listen** claims associated with it. Copy the **Primary Connection String** from the fly-out menu at right. You'll use this as the **Connection String** value when connecting to the queue from Algorithmia, and it will look something like:

```
Endpoint=sb://test-azure-sb-namespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=oq4/9ptgF9miVFWVRYyKaPO9Ao8qSrfVMzGFMvQzYX8=
```

#### Create resources manually

If you aren't able to use the ARM template and need to create the SB resources manually, follow the steps in the Azure documentation to [create a Service Bus namespace and queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal).

## 3. Creating an Event Flow in Algorithmia

**NOTE:** The steps in this section are to be completed on Algorithmia, from within the browser user interface (UI) or through the API. In this guide, we'll demonstrate what the workflow looks like in the UI.
{: .notice-info}

Note that you can set up _any_ algorithm to subscribe to an SB message broker so that the algorithm is executed when a message is published to that specific queue. On our platform we refer to this type of event-driven configuration as an Event Flow, and the following demonstrates one possible example of how to set one up.

### Create an algorithm

Create a Python 3.x algorithm with a generic Python 3.7 algorithm environment and default settings. If you're new to Algorithmia or need a quick refresher on how to create and modify algorithms, see our [Getting Started Guide](/algorithm-development/your-first-algo).

On the newly created algorithm's profile, click the **Source** tab to access the source code in the Web IDE.

In the body of your algorithm, paste the source code below, replacing the `COLLECTION_OWNER` and `COLLECTION_NAME` with your Algorithmia account name and the name of a data collection (which you'll create in a subsequent step), respectively. In the screenshot below the sample code, these values are `Ezra` and `TestingSQSEventFlow`, respectively.

```python
import Algorithmia

client = Algorithmia.client()

def apply(input):
    data_uri = "data://COLLECTION_OWNER/COLLECTION_NAME/" + input.get("filename")
    client.file(data_uri).put(input.get("data"))
```

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/algorithmia-web-ide-azure-sb-subscriber.png">

Click the **Save** and **Build** buttons and then click **Publish** when the build completes.

On the newly published algorithm's profile, copy the algorithm endpoint, which will be in the form `ALGO_OWNER/ALGO_NAME/ALGO_VERSION`; in the screenshot below, this is `ezra/testAzureSB/0.1.0`.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/algorithm-profile-algorithm-endpoint-sb-subscriber.png" alt="algorithm profile algorithm endpoint">

### Create a hosted data collection

Now create a hosted data collection to which the algorithm above will write the records read from the message broker. To begin, click the **Data Sources** menu item in the left-hand navigation bar. Click **New Data Source** and then **Hosted Data Collection**.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/create-hosted-data-collection.png" alt="Create Algorithmia hosted data collection">

In the dialog box that appears, enter the `COLLECTION_NAME` value from above (in this case, `TestingSBEventFlow`) and click **Create Collection**.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/new-collection-sb-event-flow.png" alt="New hosted data collection dialog">

### Connect to an SB message broker

This section documents the workflow in Algorithmia versions >=20.5.53. See the section [below](#create-an-event-listener) for the previous event listeners-based workflow.
{: .notice-info}

Navigate to your new algorithm's profile and click the **Events** tab and then the **Connect broker** button.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/connect_sb_broker_button.png">

In the modal, enter the **Queue Name** and **Connection String** values from [above](#create-a-service-bus-namespace-and-queue-using-an-arm-template).

The **Algorithm** endpoint field is auto-populated, and the full algorithm path is shown below the text input field. The version number is optional.

Optionally, enter a value for **Algorithm timeout in seconds**.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/connect_sb_broker_modal.png">

Click **Connect to Azure SB broker**. The **Events** tab on the algorithm profile will now list your newly created connection.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/connect_sqs_broker_events_tab.png">

Click [here](#4-sending-messages-to-the-broker) to skip to the next step to learn how to send messages to the newly connected broker.

### Create an Event Listener

This section documents the workflow in Algorithmia versions <20.5.53, where Event Flows were called event listeners.
{: .notice-info}

Navigate to the **Home** tab on the left-hand navigation menu. Click on the **Create New** button and select **Event Listener**. Select **Azure SB** from the dropdown.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_38.png">

In the modal, enter the **Queue Name** and **Connection String**.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_27.png">

Enter the full path to the algorithm you created above and click **Create New Event Listener**. The **Listeners** tab on the algorithm profile will now list your newly created event listener.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/image_28.png">

## 4. Sending messages to the broker

Many methods exist for sending messages to Azure SB queues. For the purposes of this demonstration, here we show how to do it using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-python-how-to-use-queues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure's Python SDK for Service Bus queues</a>.

### Create an algorithm

To begin, create another Python 3.x algorithm with a generic Python 3.7 algorithm environment and default settings.

#### Store the connection string in the Secret Store

On the newly created algorithm's profile, click the **Settings** tab and find the **Secret Store** section. Add a new secret called `CONNECTION_STR` with the contents of the connection string from the [SB message broker connection](#connect-to-an-sb-broker) step above. For more information on how to use the secret store, see the [Secret Store](/developers/platform/secret-store/) docs.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/secret-service-bus-namespace-connection-string.png">

#### Modify, build, and publish the algorithm

Click the **Dependencies** button and add the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/azure-servicebus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Service Bus package</a>, which Algorithmia will pull down automatically from PyPI when the algorithm is built. (If developing locally, you'll add this to the `requirements.txt` file.)

```
algorithmia>=1.0.0,<2.0
azure-servicebus==7.3.1
```

In the body of your algorithm, paste the source code below, replacing the `QUEUE_NAME` value with the **Queue Name** string from the [SB message broker connection](#connect-to-an-sb-broker) step above. For more details on how to use this SDK, including how to send messages in batches, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-python-how-to-use-queues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure's Service Bus SDK documentation</a>.

```python
import os

import Algorithmia
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient, ServiceBusMessage

CONNECTION_STR = os.getenv("CONNECTION_STR")
QUEUE_NAME = "QUEUE_NAME"


def send_single_message(sender, message):
    # Send the message to the queue
    sender.send_messages(message)
    print("Sent a single message.")


def apply(input):
    """Send a message to the queue.

    input format:
      {"filename": "some-new-file.txt", "data": "file contents to store"}
    """

    # Create a Service Bus message
    message = ServiceBusMessage(input.get("data"))
    # Create a Service Bus client using the connection string
    servicebus_client = ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(
      conn_str=CONNECTION_STR,
      logging_enable=True)
    with servicebus_client:
        # Get a Queue Sender object to send messages to the queue
        sender = servicebus_client.get_queue_sender(queue_name=QUEUE_NAME)
        with sender:
            # Send one message
            send_single_message(sender, message)
    return "Sent a message to the queue."
```

Click the **Save** and **Build** buttons, and then **Publish** the algorithm.

## 3. Sending messages to the SB queue

To send a test message, call the algorithm with input in the following format.

```json
{
    "filename": "some-new-file.txt",
    "data": "file contents to store"
}
```

To verify, open the **Data Sources** menu item in the left sidebar and navigate to the `COLLECTION_NAME` data collection that you configured above as the destination for your algorithm to write data. Based on the payload shown above in the **Message body** section, the collection should contain the file `some-new-file`, with contents equal to the string `file contents to store`.

<img src="{{site.cdnurl}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/post_images/eventlisteners/azure-sb-file-contents.png">

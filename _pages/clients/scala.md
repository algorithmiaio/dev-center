This guide provides a walk-through of how to use the official Algorithmia Scala Client to call algorithms and manage data through the Algorithmia platform.

Here you will learn how to install the Algorithmia Scala Client, work with the Data API by uploading and downloading files, create and update directories and permission types and last, you'll learn how to call an algorithm that summarizes text files.

To follow along you can create a new Scala project in the IDE of your choice.



## Getting Started with Algorithmia

The Algorithmia Scala Client is published to Maven central and additional reference documentation can be found in the [Algorithmia Scala Client API Docs](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.algorithmia/algorithmia-scala_2.11) and the [Algorithmia API docs](http://docs.algorithmia.com/?scala).

To get started, the Algorithmia Scala Client can be added as a library through Maven using your IDE of choice or you can [download the JAR file](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.algorithmia/algorithmia-scala) and add it as a dependency in your SBT file:

{% highlight scala %}
libraryDependencies += "com.algorithmia" %% "algorithmia-scala" % "0.9.5"
{% endhighlight %}

## Authentication

Next, login to [Algorithmia](/) to get your [API key](/user#credentials):

Now import Algorithmia and create the client object by passing in your API key:

{% highlight scala %}
import com.algorithmia.{Algorithmia, AlgorithmiaClient}

val client = Algorithmia.client("YOUR_API_KEY")
{% endhighlight %}

Now youâ€™re ready to start working with Algorithmia in Scala.

{% if site.enterprise %}
#### Enterprise Users Only: Specifying an On-Premises or Private Cloud Endpoint
If you are running [Algorithmia Enterprise](/enterprise), you can specify the API endpoint when you create the client object:

{% highlight scala %}
val client = Algorithmia.client("YOUR_API_KEY", "https://mylocalendpoint")
{% endhighlight %}

Alternately, you can ensure that each of your servers interacting with your Algorithmia Enterprise instance have an environment variable named `ALGORITHMIA_API` and the client will use it.  The fallback API endpoint is always the hosted Algorithmia marketplace service at [https://api.algorithmia.com/](https://api.algorithmia.com/)
{% endif %}

## Working with Data Using the Data API

For application developers, [Algorithmia's Data Portal](/data) offers three different ways to store your data, all available via the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/#data-api-specification).

This guide will show you how to work with the [Hosted Data]({{site.baseurl}}/data/hosted) option on the Algorithmia platform which is available to both algorithm and application developers.

### Prerequisites
If you wish to follow along working through the example yourself, create a text file that contains any unstructured text such as a chapter from a public domain book or article. We used a chapter from [Burning Daylight, by Jack London](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Burning_Daylight) which you can copy and paste into a text file. Or copy and paste it from here: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data_assets/burning_daylight.txt">Chapter One Burning Daylight, by Jack London</a>. This will be used throughout the guide.

### Create a Data Collection

This section will show how to create a data collection which is essentially a folder of data files hosted on Algorithmia for free.

Import the DataDirectory object to work with data collections:

{% highlight scala %}
import com.algorithmia.data._
{% endhighlight %}

Now create a data collection called nlp_directory:

{% highlight Scala %}
// Instantiate a DataDirectory object, set your data URI and call create
val nlp_directory = client.dir("data://YOUR_USERNAME/nlp_directory")
try {
  if (nlp_directory.exists == false) {
    nlp_directory.create()
  }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Data Directory Error: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

A Data URI uniquely identifies files and directories and contains a protocol "data://" and path "YOUR_USERNAME/data_collection". For more information on the Data URI see the [Data API Specification](http://docs.algorithmia.com/#data-api-specification).

Instead of your username you can also use '.my' when calling algorithms. For more information about the '.my' pseudonym check out the [Hosted Data Guide]({{site.url}}/data/hosted).
{: .notice-info}

### Work with Directory Permissions

When we created the data collection in the previous code snippet, the default setting is `DataAclType.MY_ALGOS` which is a permission type that allows other users on the platform to interact with your data through the algorithms you create if you decide to contribute to algorithm development. This means users can call your algorithm to perform an operation on your data stored in this collection, otherwise the algorithm you created would only work for you.

Here is how you check for the data collection's permission type:

{% highlight scala %}
try {
  // Check if permissions is what you expect it to be.
  if (nlp_directory.getPermissions.read == DataMyAlgorithms) {
    System.out.println("acl is the default permissions type DataMyAlgorithms")
  }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => System.out.println("acl read problem: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now change those permissions to private:

{% highlight scala %}
try {
  // Update a directory to be public.
  nlp_directory.updatePermissions(DataAcl(read = DataPrivate))
  // Check if permissions is what you expect it to be.
  if (nlp_directory.getPermissions.read == DataPrivate) {
    System.out.println("acl is the default permissions type DataPrivate")
  }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("API Exception trying to update permissions: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that we changed our data collection to private, which means that only you will be able to read and write to your data collection.

Note that read access that is set to the default `DataMyAlgorithms` allows any algorithm you call to have access to your data collection so most often, this is the setting you want when you are calling an algorithm and are an application developer.

For more information on collection-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other data collection permissions go to the [Hosted Data Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/data/hosted).

### Upload Data to your Data Collection

So far you've created your data collection and checked and updated directory permissions. Now you're ready to upload the text file that you created at the beginning of the guide to your data collection using the Data API.

First add the necessary dependencies:

{% highlight scala %}
import java.io.File
{% endhighlight %}

Then upload your local file to the data collection using the `.putFile()` method:

{% highlight Scala %}
try {
  // Upload contents of file as a string.
  val local_file = "/your_local_file_path/jack_london.txt"
  nlp_directory.putFile(new File(local_file))
  System.out.println("Successfully wrote file to data collection.")
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Error trying to upload file: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This endpoint will replace a file if it already exists. If you wish to avoid replacing a file, check if the file exists before using this endpoint.
{: .notice-warning}

You can confirm that the file was created by navigating to Algorithmia's [Hosted Data Source](/data/hosted) and finding your data collection and file.

You can also upload your data through the UI on Algorithmia's [Hosted Data Source](/data/hosted). For instructions on how to do this go to the [Hosted Data Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/data/hosted).

### Downloading Data from a Data Collection

Next check if the file that you just uploaded to data collections exists, and try downloading it to a (new) local file:

{% highlight Scala %}
// Download the file
val text_file = "data://YOUR_USERNAME/nlp_directory/jack_london.txt"
try {
    if (client.file(text_file).exists()) {
        client.file(text_file).getFile()
    } else {
        System.out.println("Please check that your file exists")
    }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Could not download file locally: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This copies the file from your data collection and saves it as a file on your local machine, storing the filename in the variable `localfile`.

Alternately, if you just need the text content of the file to be stored in a variable, you can retrieve the remote file's content without saving the actual file:

{% highlight Scala %}
// Download contents of file as a string
val text_file = "data://YOUR_USERNAME/nlp_directory/jack_london.txt"
try {
    if (client.file(text_file).exists()) {
        client.file(text_file).getString()
    } else {
        System.out.println("Please check that your file exists")
    }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Could not get file contents: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will get your file as a string, saving it to the variable `input`.  If the file was binary (an image, etc), you could instead use the function `.getBytes()` to retrieve the file's content as a byte array. For more image-manipulation tutorials, see the [Computer Vision Recipes]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/recipes/#computer-vision).

Now you've seen how to upload a local data file, check if a file exists in a data collection, and download the file contents.

For more methods on how to get a file using the Data API from a data collection go to the [API Specification](http://docs.algorithmia.com/#getting-a-file).

## Call an Algorithm

Finally we are ready to call an algorithm. In this guide we'll use the natural language processing algorithm called [Summarizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer). This algorithm results in a string that is the summary of the text content you pass in as the algorithm's input.

A single algorithm may have different input and output types, or accept multiple types of input, so consult the algorithmâ€™s description for usage examples specific to that algorithm.
{: .notice-info}

This example shows the summary of the text file which we downloaded from our data collection and set as the variable called `input` in the previous code sample.

Add this import to call algorithms:

{% highlight Scala %}
import com.algorithmia.algo.Algorithm
{% endhighlight %}

Create the algorithm object and pass in the variable `input` into `algo.pipe()`:

{% highlight Scala %}
val text_file = "data://YOUR_USERNAME/nlp_directory/jack_london.txt"
// Download contents of file as a string
try {
  if (client.file(text_file).exists) {
    val input = client.file(text_file).getString
    try {
      val algo = client.algo("nlp/Summarizer/0.1.3")
      val result = algo.pipe(input).asString
      System.out.println(result)
    } catch {
      case e: Exception => println("Algorithm error: " + e.getMessage)
    }
  }
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Error trying to download file: " + e.getMessage)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This guide used the the first chapter of [Jack London's Burning Daylight](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Burning_Daylight) and the Summarizer algorithm outputs:

"It was a quiet night in the Shovel. The miners were in from Moseyed Creek and the other diggings to the west, the summer washing had been good, and the men's pouches were heavy with dust and nuggets. MacDonald grinned and nodded, and opened his mouth to speak, when the front door swung wide and a man appeared in the light."

### Limits

Your account can make up to {{site.data.stats.platform.max_num_algo_requests}} Algorithmia requests at the same time (this limit <a onclick="Intercom('show')">can be raised</a> if needed).

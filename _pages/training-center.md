## Overview

Our Training Center hosts tutorials for getting up and running on Algorithmia. We also have advanced content for experienced Algorithmia users to find details on platform features and best practices. Course topics include introductory material on algorithm development, development best practices, data source integration, organization management, and platform administration.

If you're new to Algorithmia, the Training Center is a great place to get started. You're invited to complete an entire learning path or to just take an individual course or lesson.

If you're an experienced algorithm developer and you'd like a more detailed explanation of a topic covered here in the Developer Center (this site), the Training Center is great resource as well!

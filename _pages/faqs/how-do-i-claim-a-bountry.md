To claim the bounty, first make sure that the algorithm is published under your account. Then go to the bounty page, click the "Fulfill Bounty" button and follow the steps to select your algorithm. The bounty poster will have 30 days to review your algorithm, give feedback, and accept the submission. If accepted, we will notify you and credit your account. For more details go to [Bounty Terms & Conditions](https://algorithmia.com/bounty_terms) page.

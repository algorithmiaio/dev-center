When adding your algorithm to the marketplace, you can determine the unit of charge in Algorithmia credits. Each time your algorithm is called through the API, we meter it and charge the caller's credit account. 

The option to Cash Out earned credits appears once you've earned $100 or more worth of credits.

When you're ready to cash out on the credits you've earned as an algorithm developer, we use PayPal to securely deliver your earnings.

Although you are able to change the royalty fee when releasing new versions, please note that algorithms which are made available for free are not allowed to charge later on minor version changes. This ensures that users of the algorithm have predictable access to a particular version. Compute time will still have a cost for users accessing your algorithm even if it is open source and royalty free.

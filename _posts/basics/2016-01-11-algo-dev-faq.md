With the Algorithmia platform, you can get your algorithms in to the hands of developers, researchers, and businesses. In this FAQ, you can find quick answers to common questions about algorithm development.

## What languages can I write my algorithm in?

We currently support algorithm development in Java, Scala, and Python. We are adding new languages constantly. To request a language send us email at <a href="mailto:support@algorithmia.com">support@algorithmia.com</a>.

## Who can contribute to the Algorithmia Marketplace?

Anyone can contribute algorithms to the marketplace!

## I am an algorithm developer, how do I make money?

When adding your algorithm to the marketplace, you can determine the unit of charge in Algorithmia credits. Each time your algorithm is called through the API, we meter it and charge the caller's credit account. When you're ready to cash out on the credits you've earned as an algorithm developer, we use PayPal to securely deliver your earnings.

Although you are able to change the royalty fee when releasing new versions, please note that algorithms which are made available for free are not allowed to charge later on minor version changes. This ensures that users of the algorithm have predictable access to a particular version. Compute time will still have a cost for users accessing your algorithm even if it is open source and royalty free.

## I want my algorithm to be open source, can my algorithm be free of royalty charges?

Yes! You can make your work completely open source and free while allowing developers across the world access to your algorithm. As an incentive to promote community contributions, open source algorithms on the Algorithmia Platform will earn 1% of the usage cost (0.01cr/sec of execution time).

## How do I avoid others copying my source code?

Algorithmia has multiple permission modes for your algorithm, including viewable source code and private code. While we encourage making your source code viewable, “black-box” algorithms are allowed.

If you believe there has been a copyright violation, please report it by following the instructions under the section "Copyright Complaints" in the Terms and Conditions.

## Who owns the intellectual property rights of uploaded source code?

The author retains the intellectual property rights of their algorithm. Algorithmia never takes any ownership of your code, documents, or data. These are always owned by the original author and are free to be commercialized through channels other than Algorithmia.

## Can I use external libraries with my algorithms?

Yes, any library in Maven Central can be imported. See [this algorithm](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/kenny/LDA/edit) as an example.

## How do I claim a bounty with my algorithm?

To claim the bounty, first make sure that the algorithm is published under your account. Then go to the bounty page, click the "Fulfill Bounty" button and follow the steps to select your algorithm. The bounty poster will have 30 days to review your algorithm, give feedback, and accept the submission. If accepted, we will notify you and credit your account.
